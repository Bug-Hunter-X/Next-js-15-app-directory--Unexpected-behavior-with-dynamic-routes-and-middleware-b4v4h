# Next.js 15 App Directory: Unexpected Behavior with Dynamic Routes and Middleware

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered when using dynamic routes and middleware in the Next.js 15 App Directory.  The issue involves a mismatch between expected and actual behavior when handling parameters within middleware.

## Bug Description

The middleware is expected to intercept the request and alter the response based on the dynamic route parameters. However, under specific conditions, the middleware does not seem to correctly interpret or utilize these parameters, leading to unexpected or incorrect behavior on the client-side.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior as described in the bug report.

## Expected Behavior

The middleware should correctly process the dynamic route parameter and respond accordingly, resulting in the expected outcome on the client side.

## Actual Behavior

The middleware fails to correctly use the dynamic route parameter, resulting in unintended client behavior.  The specific behavior varies depending on the conditions, as described in the bug report.

## Solution

The solution involves a change in how parameters are handled within the middleware. Refer to `bugSolution.js` for the corrected implementation.
